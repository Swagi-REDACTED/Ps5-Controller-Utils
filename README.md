# Ps5-Controller-Utils

first lemme say i made this for playing schedule 1 while my keyboard was broken thank god for ai and the on-screen-keyboard ended up making it compatible with any game

next lemme say I'll continue updating this as I see fit if people want and need updates ill provide them no one will ever use this though more than likely

# Directions:
pretty easy to setup

1. install python 3.13 or similar(i.e. 3.11).

2. Run "pip install pystray pillow pynput pydirectinput dualsense-controller" in powershell To install any missing dependencies.

3. Run the CNK(Controller N' Keyoard).py script it will open in system tray.

4. if using the exe you should be good to skip steps 2 and 3 instead just run the exe after installing python and it will start in system tray.

5. if for any reason the exe doesnt work please report the error in Issues and provide any logs you can.

6. It should now be available from you're system tray set it up to you're liking and enjoy playing mnk games with a controller!!

# Pasted commentsVV
-- as such theres some compatibility options built in to help it work with you're preferred game 

-- if it doesnt work i suggest attempting to fix it yourself also please report any issues or incompatibilities to the github and ensure you post any fixes

-- it will likely not work on games with aggressive ac scanning I.E. Valorant/Siege you'll have to test it yourself
