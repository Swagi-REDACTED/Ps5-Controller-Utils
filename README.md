# Ps5-Controller-Utils

first lemme say i made this for playing schedule 1 while my keyboard was broken thank god for ai and the on-screen-keyboard ended up making it compatible with any game
next lemme say I'll continue updating this as I see fit if people want and need updates ill provide them no one will ever use this though more than likely

# Directions:
pretty easy 1. Just install python 3.13 or similar
2. Run "pip install pystray pillow pynput pydirectinput dualsense-controller" To install any missing dependencies
3. Run the CNK(Controller N' Keyoard).py script
4. if using the exe you should be good to skip steps 2 and 3 instead just run the exe after installing pythong
5. if for any reason the exe doesnt work please report the error and provide any logs you can

# Pasted commentsVV
== as such theres some compatibility options built in to help it work with you're preferred game 
== if it doesnt work i suggest attempting to fix it yourself also please report any issues or incompatibilities to the github and ensure you post any fixes
== it will likely not work on games with aggressive ac scanning I.E. Valorant/Siege you'll have to test it yourself
